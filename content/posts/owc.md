This is something that I have yearned for the longest. I have always wanted to dive properly, get certified, and  
obtain that freedom to dive wherever I go. I finally have got it. A certified OpenWater Diver is what I am now. It feels 
good, amazing, blissful, grateful, extremely lucky and free. Free from the age long constraints that I have had put on me
since the longest time.  I finally feel that I am free. I finally felt that I was free. In the water, I felt natural. 
Much more natural than on land. Walking will be probably be a developed taste for me. Swimming in the ocean felt 
second nature to me. Graduated with almost no mistakes made, no feedback that I got from my instructor. Just improve
your SAC. But the feeling of being in the water and moving as you please. Oh man ! Nothing can really beat it. I feel extremely 
off knowing now that I won't be able to dive for a long time. Possibly months before I take my next dive. It makes me 
feel extremely sad. I loved diving. I don't think I have loved a lot of things recently this much. There is an ache
, a familiar one, that I get when I see the sea. I am finally free there of everything. Writing this does make me 
tear up slightly. My feelings are something that I have no control over. And they have finally shown me what I am, 
what I like. I am not a tech guy. I am not as pro development as I thought I would be. I don't love tall skyscrapers, 
huge led boards, tech innovations just for the sake of it. What I love is more grounded. Grounded in nature. Nature. 
Prospering unfettered nature. Undisturbed areas that are still up for exploring, not up for grab.

We got 5 dives in our OWC. Started with a very simple dive in Nemos reef on our 2nd day of the course in Havelock. 
Followed up with 2 shore dives exploring Nemos both sides and finally 2 boat dives around the Wall and the Slope on the 
final day. All of the dives are a little amalgamated. Bits and pieces of each dive have been mixed so as to make each 
dive almost impossible to separate out, like a good glass of masala chai. However, there are components and fish that 
I remember from all of the dives. These are individual bits and pieces that stick out and lemme know what I loved about
each of the dive. The first dive in Nemos was extremely forgettable. A very 'skill-focussed' dive where me and my buddies
(3 of us + instructor) where focussed on getting a handle on our bouyancy and control our movements in the water along 
with completing multiple skills at the start and end. The surface was sandy, we might have touched around 8 meters in 
depth and could easily, and did too, crash on the surface multiple times. We had our first encounter with the jeep and 
Indian idols placed in the water for coral restoration. We could see fish swimming in groups around both the surfaces 
but did not venture too close to either of the objects. The next day we had two dives in Nemo and both of the dives
focussed on different areas of the fringing reef. We ended up swimming along the reef exploring the reef and surrounding
objects, corals, boulders, and rubble. The dives were pretty. We got to 5 different types of anemonefish including the 
famed 'nemo'. These guys were pretty, small, and looked delicate. I got bit by a 'white/yellow damsel'. Apparently, 
that's the oceans way of saying good job you are a part of us. We saw butterfly fish, a huge grouper resting on coral 
waiting to ambush other peeps, rabbitfish and parrotfish among others. One of the most memorable moments was seeing the 
cleaner wrasse cleaning a 'rabbitfish' (?) and moving into its gills and in and around its mouth. Also saw a slingjaw 
wrasse open its mouth in the most interesting way to gobble up something that I didn't catch a glimpse of (oops). 
Saw a couple of huge barrel corals which were extremely interesting objects to view underwater. Pictures don't justify
their glamour. Amazing creatures. The freckled goatfish filter feeding across the floor was an amazing sight. So were
the fusiliers and cardinal fish roaming around in huge schools. It was beautiful to know that you could swim around 
and partially through such creatures. We also had a very murky sighting of a couple of humphead wrasses. They are huge, 
beautiful (beauty is in the eyes of the beholder) and a little scary. Moorish idols were pretty af, we saw a lot of them 
on all of our dives. Tube worms were a very interesting sight. Pipefish was the cringiest and among the cutest creatures
that I have come across underwater. It gives a very interesting, almost like saying 'aree naa baba' reaction when you 
move your hand towards it. Distances a little and shakes rapidly a little in a very weird manner. Triggerfish, 
surgeonfish, snappers (checkered I remember 'acche se') and sea cucumbers were a common sight. 

Our next two dives were in the beautiful patch of sea between Havelock Islands lighthouse and the Island facing it. 
These both were gorgeous sights with extremely pretty and active marine life. These sites were way deeper and we saw
many more fish just roaming around us. These sites were called the Wall and the Slope respectively. Both these sites
are found on a deep ridge found between Havelock and ___. One side of this ridge is the deep drop called the Wall while
the other is a gradual slope called the Slope. We descended at the Wall using a line descent. That started out a little 
clumsily but as soon as we let it go and started venturing out into the ocean, we were greeted by huge chunks of coral
along with a huge array of all sorts of fish. There were large AF Trevallys roaming around together, a beautiful school 
of Fusiliers, and multiple trigger and parrotfish. The more interesting sightings included the single humphead wrasse 
which appears intimidating just because of its large size. A couple of beautiful AF Angelfish that reinstill your belief
in colors and the beauty of patterns. An extremely pretty yet camoflaged scorpionfish that while being very poisonous 
was just chilling out by itself on the reef. Finally, a partially occluded lionfish was something that I spotted but 
couldn't tell my diving buddies about in the water. This was one of those moments when the beauty of diving struck me.
You could be so close to an extremely deadly creature without any extra precautions half-naked. Yet feel safe and 
observe whatever you wanted to. Next up was the slope. We had a free descent into the water and a minute or two after 
the descent spotted a beautiful octopus partially hidden but more or less observed. The biggest barrel sponge I have 
ever seen was here. About 2-3 feet in its diameter. Beautiful piece of work by organisms much more 'trivial' than us.
Soon after we also spotted two cuttlefish feeding on the floor and chilling out. Undisturbed by our presence they 
continued to do whatever they were doing. We spotted one later that we swam with, at a distance of 7ish feet from us. 
But just the feeling of it moving with us was sublime. Almost like there was a very trivial, yet existent, bond. A huge
number of sea starts exist at this site. Long, big, and colorful, they are an interesting sight. There were two yellow
boxfish that we spotted and my god were those peeps cute AF. When we spotted the second boxfish Sahil told me to go 
check it out on my own (bit of an independent detour from the group). Went close to it, swam between pillars, saw it, 
and felt blessed. Again one of the coolest things ever that we saw were a huge portion of the reef where sergeant majors
had laid eggs. Now these are purple blotches on the corals, that's how you could identify them. you had a couple of 
majors roaming around their eggs and fiercely protecting them, forming almost a circle of partial protection, laxman rekha. 
OTOH of the food cycle, you had moon wrasse attacking the eggs, taking in a quick bite or two and getting their share 
of their food. This was a constant process that kept happening and a beautiful sight to behold. Amazing to just see 
a small part of the food chain in action. 

The last two were dives which I probably remember for a long time just because of their role in my future diving
journey and also the experiences that they awarded (albeit for a not a lot of mehnat). Now I feel blessed, I feel a lot 
of gratitude, and I feel slightly overwhelmed whenever I see the ocean. I want to go back in. I want to see these fish 
for a longer time. I want to observe one or two fish for a longer time, just stay with them, and become a part of the 
environment. Funnily enough though the expereince of IDing fish was amazing, what I love the most was being in water 
and just fully being myself and a part of the enivornment I was in. Fully separated from whatever BS goes on around me, 
above me, and maybe under me. I was a fully functional independent unit for those 40 minutes or so and I yearn to be 
that again. However, with my current traj. there is no time limit that I can put on my next diving trip. Who knows 
when it will be, where it will be, and how much of this feeling will still be there with me then. I just wish, as of now, 
that it comes quickly because I miss it a lot.
