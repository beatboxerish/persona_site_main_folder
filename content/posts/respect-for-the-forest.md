My views, respect, admiration, and love for the forest reached a different level in Bharatpur,
Rajasthan, India on 24th Oct 2022, Monday. This is the day me and my dad got stuck in the national
 park post its closing time. This is the day when we firsthand felt what it would mean to be alone 
in a forest post with darkness engulfing you and your phones flashlight being the only thing 
keeping you from being swallowed in the darkness. 

The official closing time of the national park is around sunset. It was 6:00 PM for us at that 
time. This meant that all visitors are supposed to exit the national park by 6 PM and shouldn't
be lingering beyond that time. However, this timing is not strictly enforced. Guards won't
shoo you away if you are taking your time to exit the park and so it is possible to find yourself
exiting the park post its official closing time. This is what happened with us. Me and my dad found 
ourselves moving towards the exit at a slow pace, with the sun setting down slowly, around 5:30 PM. 
Our 'chaal' was slow and relaxing and we were taking our time to enjoy our time literally 
inside nature. 

The walk from one end of the park to the entry/exit gate is around 6 KM. As time went on, 
darkness started growing around us. We started getting engulfed in it very slowly. The darkness and the shadows
were like a gown we were being donned. We didn't want it but we couldn't resist it. Since we were
walking on a piece of road constructed through the middle of the forest, we would occasionally 
hear some animal growling, wild bulls/antelopes (nilgai) mooing, small critters crittering (or whatever they do),
and birds chirping in a 'calling it a day' vibe. It felt more a forest than any other time I had been in a forest.

`As a note: I write all by content slowly, whenever I get time. Though this makes it tough to recall
everything perfectly, I believe it does allow one to live a particular event/experience multiple 
times.`

We must have been halfway through the journey when we saw two wild bulls on the road minding their own business
in front of us. Now consider some facts. These were wild bulls. The straight narrow road was only 3-4 meters wide.
On both sides of the road was water which was a part of a huge lake. As a result, we were, simply put, terrified.
If they charged at us, we wouldn't have any place to run to. We wouldn't be able to run away from them. We wouldn't
be able to jump out of their path. We would just be mauled. Luckily we retreated, found some 0.5 - 1 meter long
wood pieces lying around that we used to scare them away. They went away into the water on the sides and we continued.
This same incident happened a couple of times on that road. Post some time, I think I grew a little over confident.
I dropped the stick that I was carrying. When asked why by my dad, I told him quite embarrisingly that nothing will 
happen to me because I am nature's son.
