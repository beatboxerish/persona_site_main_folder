Hello there...  

As this world become crazier, messier, and increasingly distant, I have 
decided to find and establish my place in it through this website. It took
me a while to finally work a little and create a home for my digital self but 
thanks to [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/), someone has a new place for themselves
that they might grow to like and call home.

My journey to where I am on `2022-09-25` has been a fun yet tortuous branch of 
 your typical Indian upper middle class trajectory. I have represented India
internationally in 
[`beatboxing`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17K9Aeuas0g&t=57s), have 
switched to a `'data sciencey et coderish' lifestyle` 
(I work [here](https://locus.sh/) as a data scientist) from a 'I will 
work on my art till the time it's perfect' lifestyle, 
have recently started appreciating `wildlife and birding` a lot (Some of 
my online blog haunts: [Mongabay](https://india.mongabay.com/),
[NatureInFocus](https://www.natureinfocus.in/home),
[JLRExplore](https://jlrexplore.com/)), and have some inevitable plans on
`pivoting from my current job to try out a startup idea` that I have. 


Years ahead from now, I see myself owning a chain of wildlife 
conservation-based resorts which sucks on money from bourgeois tourists and
puts the acquired wealth back into places where there is an acute shortage
of it i.e. into the wildlife and conservation industry. The idea is to 
allow consumers to enjoy wildlife in a very safe, intelligent, and aware 
manner whereby each experience will be designed and guided by the locals of 
that place and each dish and each drink will carry notes and flavours of the 
land in which the consumer stays. An extremely holistic, raw, and grounded 
experience to help save what we humans are carelessly destroying...
