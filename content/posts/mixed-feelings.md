I had my official in office farewell today. It was a quaint gathering organized by our CHO (let's see if you can find 
out what this means). We had a couple of cakes that I couldn't eat (thanks bangalore weather caused phlem), a couple of
people that cared about me and a couple people amiss. I gave an underwhelming farewell speech, with a smile on my face 
grinning eye to eye, so hard that my cheek muscle twitched publicly when I tried to smile a few seconds later, multiple
times. It hurt to force a smile in the first place on my farewell. It also hurt to see the lack of people that turned up
on my farewell. It also didnt feel good that almost no one took time to speak about their experiences with me. Was it
because of the conductor ? Or was it because no one really cares about me ? 

I am central to my life. I am the center of my story. I might have motivations that are more benevolent but I still 
remain the center of whenever I think and whatever I think. Self-obsessed in a weird way...I am little crazy that way.
My inner mind is at least. It is all encomassing and judges everything I do, now a little less than before (thank god!). 
Is my gait masc. enough ? Am I wiping the sweat off of my face correctly ? Why is everyone looking at me ? And if no one
is, then why not ? What is wrong ? There always has to be something wrong and that wrong is usually highly visible and 
evident. Thus, I get tired. 

However, post the anticlimatic farewell, I did have a couple of one on ones with a few people whose company I cherish and
honestly, that meant the world to me. That hit me where it should have. Told me, that I belong. I belong with someone 
at the very least. Funnily enough I write this from my friends place where I am staying over for a day. I shouldn't be 
complaining. 

Leaving my flatmates was also a weirdly emotional experience. They went till the cab to drop me, hugged me, we bid goodbyes
multiple times and all of it felt organic and pure. Whatever our interactions had been, they had been good, pure, and 
organic. Nothing like in an office setup over trivial small talk with a certain forced laughter. Makes me think, what 
am I looking for ? What sort of people do I wanna spend time with and wanna get to know ? Also I have never experienced
this sort of a male bonding, however light it was. I liked it and it felt nice. One thing I learnt was that you have to 
be vulnerable with others, no matter guys or girls, to actually form a friendship. You have to be you, no matter how 
judgey you are of yourself and how much you hate that inner Ishan. You have to let yourself out. Talk about stuff that
matters to you, engage in talks about things that matter to other people, reveal yourself in your discussions. Its a 
beautiful interplay of where and on whom the limelight falls as the limelight keeps on slowly revealing the person 
underneath to people around that person. I felt accepted, free, and complete after a long time. This was something 
that I didn't know could happen even after the scant talks that me and my flat mates had had. Wow....tearing up. I will 
miss them.

You need to be freer bro. Enjoy and express yourself. This doesn't mean that you should be going crazy all the time. But
rather, feel free to chill out, be crass, and ek dum chutiya with some people. Explore yourself and your connections 
by showing your true colors. 
Thanks guys, I owe you one.
