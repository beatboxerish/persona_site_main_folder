**Context**: I have started working on an idea that could be a potential startup. I will be 
quitting my job in a few days and from Dec 1st, I will be working full time on my startup. Since 
I am a novice in the field, and pretty the underdog, my first step has been to start 
preparing myself for what is to come. This preparation includes thinking and writing about the 
idea in depth, reading books about startups and deep work, reading articles on the same, and 
trying to understand the type and level of commitment that will be required going ahead.  
As a part of this process, I have had the honor of talking to tons of people who have had 
their own startups. Both people who have failed and succeeded. Some of the lessons that I have
learnt through this vicarious living experiment follow suit.
