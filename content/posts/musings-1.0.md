Recently, I have been feeling a little lonely. A little alone in this beautiful 
city called Bangalore. Down with viral, there's not much to do apart from `limited
eating outside`, `limited physical activity`, and `limited social energy`.  
On any normal day, badminton would be my go-to activity. I would end up sweating, 
learning a new skill, socializing, and clearing my thoughts. All of these are extremely
important needs of mine that I need to give time to whenever and wherever to function
productively. dkjd
