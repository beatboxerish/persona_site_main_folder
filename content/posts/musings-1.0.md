Recently, I have been feeling a little lonely. A little alone in this beautiful 
city called Bangalore. Down with viral, there's not much that I can do apart from `limited
eating outside`, `limited physical activity`, and `limited social energy`.  
On any normal day, badminton would be my go-to activity. I would end up exercising, 
learning a new skill, socializing, and clearing my thoughts. All of these are extremely
important needs that I need to give time to whenever and wherever to function
productively. However, in recent times, I have come to observe that loneliness seems to 
have also become an important component of what I am. It's one of those necessary evils 
that allows me to do what I want to do whenever I want to do. It gives me a ton of 
flexibility and helps create an extremely malleable day. Thus, it helps me be very independent
and live without any dependencies and constraints.  
If I am lonely:
* I get to exercise whenever I want to
* Read the blogs and books that I want to
* Give time to my mind to relax and meander through the plethora of thoughts that sojourn in it daily
* Work on whichever personal projects I feel like

However, it is loneliness. `And it is lonely being lonely.` On a weekend when you are having 
a beer by yourself, it does hit you. Why ? To what end ? Let's forget this and go out and party.
Let's not watch this one interview but instead go out for a movie. These questions are tough 
to answer and even tougher to say no to. But it's also the no that's been keeping me extremely 
productive and satisfied. `So it seems like loneliness is making me productive as it gives me 
the power of complete independence.` But, can we not achieve complete independence without the 
constraint/side effect of loneliness ? Can I not be highly productive along with not being 
lonely ? Is there a way to do that ? And if that way does exist then what sort of state would 
I end up in post following that way ? How would that state be different from my current state ? 
Is loneliness one side of the double-edged sword of high independence ? Or is this just being 
independent and highly productive something that I am extremely poor at ? These are some 
questions that I want to find the answer to going ahead. `Movies have helped me romanticise 
loneliness a lot, but once you are post the romance of it, that shit does take a toll.`
